        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for the OnServerInit website,
        http://www.onserverinit.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        OnServerInit is committed to providing you with the best possible customer service experience.
        OnServerInit is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which sets out a number of principles
        concerning the privacy of individuals.
      </p>
      <h2 class="font-semibold leading-tight text-2xl mt-4">
        Collection of Your Personal Information
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are many aspects of the site which can be viewed without providing personal information,
        however, for access to future OnServerInit customer support features you are required to submit
        personally identifiable information. This may include but not limited to a unique username and
        password, or provide sensitive information in the recovery of your lost password.
      </p>
      <h2 class="font-semibold leading-tight text-2xl mt-4">
        Sharing of Your Personal Information
      </h2>
      <p>
        We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including but not
        limited to handling customer support enquiries, processing transactions or customer freight
        shipping. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to
        deliver the service. OnServerInit takes reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations are
        bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal
        information.
      </p>
      <h2 class="font-semibold leading-tight text-2xl mt-4">
        Use of your personal information
      </h2>
      <p>
        For each visitor to reach the site, we expressively collect the following non-personally
        identifiable information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language,
        operating system, pages viewed while browsing the Site, page access times and referring website
        address. This collected information is used solely internally for the purpose of gauging visitor
        traffic, trends and delivering personalized content to you while you are at this Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously
        disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future
        we will use for these new purposes only, data collected from the time of the policy change
        forward will adhere to our updated practices.
      </p>

        have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use the Site.
